    "\n",
    "On Dec. 20, 1966, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) switched to a fully automated computerized trading system. A few years later, in 1971, Nasdaq launched as the world's first fully electronic stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the Nasdaq's digital marketplaces handle over 6 billion stock purchases, representing over $200 billion, each day!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great example of how software can be used to model and emulate real-world objects and processes ([and a reminder of the real-world importance of testing and debugging code!](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nasdaq-halt-glitch-idUSBRE97S11420130829)).

    "\n",
    "### Define the Problem\n",
    "In the first part of our problem, we want to read historical stock price data from a file and store it within variables in our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we'll use the csv file `netflix_stock_data.csv` which contains the daily Netflix stock prices between Oct. 26 and Nov. 18, 2022 (alternatively, you can download a csv file of Netflix stock prices for the last month here: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nflx/historical).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first column in the csv file contains a date and the second column contains the price of a single stock on that date. We'll ignore the other columns for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to store this historical price information in our program is using a **dictionary**. We will use the dates (strings) as **keys** and the corresponding prices (floats) as **values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Test Cases\n",
    "We can use the file of Netflix stock prices as a test case. Some things that we will want to consider when determining if our solution is correct:\n",
    "* Are the keys in the dictionary strings? Are they all valid dates?\n",
    "* Are the values in the dictionary floats?\n",
    "* Are the prices in the dictionary paired with the correct dates?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate solutions\n",
    "Based on the problem definition, here are some things that our program will need to do:\n",
    "* Open a csv file for reading\n",
    "* Extract date and price information from the first and second column on each line in the file\n",
    "* Add the date and price information to a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm plan could be:\n",
    "1. Create an empty dictionary\n",
    "2. Open the csv file for reading\n",
    "3. Use a loop to process each line in the file, for each line:\n",
    "    a. Extract the date and price\n",
    "    b. Add the date and price pair to the dictionary\n",
    "4. Close the file\n"
